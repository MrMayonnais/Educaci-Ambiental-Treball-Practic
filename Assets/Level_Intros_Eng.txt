I'm at the top of the Gaià!
To begin the journey, we must prove we understand where I've come from.
There are only 8 drops of knowledge to collect at this level! Answer the
questions correctly about the headwaters of the Gaià and its first secrets to
gain momentum and continue its course to the sea.
Into the water!

Whew! What a trip, right?
I have climbed up to the river from an underground spring.
The Gaià River doesn't flow as fast here anymore, and the landscape has
changed.
On the banks, local plants and animals coexist with others that have arrived
from afar.
Here I will learn to recognize species, and together we will discover the cultural
heritage of the area.
Will you help me observe and make connections?

We've reached the lower section, the last stretch of the Gaià River.
Here the water is slow, and the river becomes more fragile. Observe, connect the dots,
and answer the questions to discover its wildlife, flow, and mouth.
Let's continue our journey!
