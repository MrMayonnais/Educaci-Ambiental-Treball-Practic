Hello! My name is Gaieta and I’m a water molecule.
I was born in the Boix river, which is part of Gaià’s headwaters. Although it may seem
small, Gaià river doesn't originate from a single source; it collects water from various
streams, brooks, and underground springs, increasing its flow over approximately 59
km. 
//
All the waters of the river basin make Gaià a fluvial axis that organizes the territory,
where we can find medieval castles and protected nature reserves.
My companions tell me to just let myself be carried along by the riverbed until I reach
the Mediterranean, but I don't want to miss this opportunity to explore the area and
make new friends.
//
In the upper reaches of the river, where the current is faster, spectacular pools and
small ponds form, creating very fragile ecosystems teeming with life. Here lives the
salamander, an amphibian that needs clean water and moist soil to survive. 
//
I've been told that as I go downstream, the river widens and forms meanders. There
I'll be able to meet the squalius cephalus and see the riverside forest that provides
shelter for many animals like birds and mammals. I can't wait to see it all!
//
In the final stretch of the journey, the water flows much more slowly, and there's also
the Catllar reservoir, which disrupts the river's connectivity. If I manage to cross it, I'll
finally reach the Mediterranean. I hope to see all the native and non-native animals
that live in the Gaià river and get to know it thoroughly, but this journey will only be
possible if the river is flowing. Will you join me on this adventure?
